# WebVR Space Demo
A WebVR project for demos utilizing Three.JS and the WebVR Boilerplate template

Now actually works with actual WebVR!

Soon to be deprecated in favor of WebXR.



# How it works

Use 1-5 keys to view different images while peacefully floating above Earth as the moon orbits in the background.

For the VR version, make sure you are using a supported browser - Firefox, Firefox Nightly, experimental Chromium, or Edge for Windows Mixed Reality Headsets.
